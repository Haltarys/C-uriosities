// This is the smallest C program that can be compiled.
// gcc compiles it (although with warnings) but g++ does not.
// When omitted, the type of functions and global variables
// is int by default and main isn't required to be a function in C.
// It does need to be defined though.
// Of course the program segfaults when executed because it
// calls the function main, which in this case isn't a function.
